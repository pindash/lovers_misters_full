All of whom are obviously named after literary giants the work can never hope to evoke. In the second paragraph we are introduced to the characters: </span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c7 subtitle" id="h.ybf2lzjtcv1w"><span class="c2">William Hugh works as a senior research analyst for a large corporation Kuotidian INC. His wife Eden Milly is a reader for a large publishing corporation Mc. The Mistress, Scarlet Pallas, works as a &nbsp;Quant Trader at a small HFT firm O&#39;Bliveeon Asset Management. The Mistress&#39;s Husband, Dilyn Thermos, is a professor of condensed matter physics at Columbia studying super conducting liquids. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&#8203;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">T</span><span class="c1">he plot moves pretty swiftly. A five year loveless affair breaks off when the </span><span class="c2">mistress&#39;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;husband comes home to find them throwing dinnerware at each other. We </span><span class="c2">learn of their </span><span class="c1">five year relationship in a flashbac</span><span class="c2">k</span><span class="c1">:</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6 c7 subtitle" id="h.8gngi2j1z84"><span class="c2">It was true. The two had met and it had been hate at first sight. They were drawn to each other like a compressed helical spring. Although they were made of the same metal, there ends were ever expanding outward. Each wanted a taste of loveless relation. They craved the anger, resentment, and meaningless sex, that was missing in their peaceful, loving marriages. Let me undeceive you this was not platonic love. There were no minds embracing. Occasionally, their bodies met. Mostly, loud and silent words were exchanged. At times, it led to all out cutlery tossing. The scars left by these encounters were a testament to both relationships. They signified the permanence of the affair and the complete love and adoration of the respective partners who always believed the most &nbsp;extraordinary excuses. </span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Th</span><span class="c2">e affair comes to an end through an elaborate misunderstanding.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;T</span><span class="c1">he condensed matter physicist </span><span class="c2">walks in on the couple but </span><span class="c1">does n</span><span class="c2">o</span><span class="c1">t </span><span class="c2">realize </span><span class="c1">an affair is taking place, instead </span><span class="c1">he believes </span><span class="c1">that </span><span class="c1">his wife</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is </span><span class="c1">defending herself against an assailant: (Who seems to be wearing very fancy attire for such an occasion.)</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6 c7 subtitle" id="h.61f0htye68y"><span class="c2">Dilyn was coming back early because his PHD students had commandeered his lab to serve levitating spirits to undergraduates pregaming Orgo night - a Columbia tradition that encourages students to behave irresponsibly in an effort to lower the average on the already difficult Organic Chemistry Final. Professor Thermos maintains his morally neutral position by leaving the students on their own, accepting that he will be cleaning the lab instead of doing research tomorrow. As he walks into his house he hears an intruder, who is being handled by his wife. &quot;Do you need help, honey?&quot; knowing very well that she does not, and that the intruder should have tried another house without one of the toughest quant traders. Some of the probabilistic irony is lost on the intruder. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The adulterers&#39; think they have been discovered and suggest that they should bring this affair to light in front of all affected parties:</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6 c7 subtitle" id="h.ihg31swuxfkz"><span class="c2">&quot; It is not what it</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;looks like</span><span class="c2">&quot; Scarlett screams over the clatter of dishes.</span></p><p class="c6 c7 subtitle" id="h.ihg31swuxfkz-1"><span class="c2">&quot;Actually it is! Your wife and I &nbsp;are having an affair. But don&rsquo;t worry, we hate each other. Have from the very start,&quot; explains William. &quot;But I think it&#39;s best we have everyone present to discuss this. Perhaps this Saturday?&quot;</span></p><p class="c6 c7 subtitle" id="h.ihg31swuxfkz-2"><span class="c2">&quot;Alright. But I suggest a beach picnic. I don&#39;t want to be stifled by the formality of French Cuisine,&quot; she replied.</span></p><p class="c6 c7 subtitle" id="h.ihg31swuxfkz-3"><span class="c2">&quot;Oh, I&rsquo;ll bring the umbrella&quot; Dilyn muttered.</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&#8203;</span><span class="c1">At the beach they decide that they must end this affair for good. As a preventative measure they suggest placing video monitors in their bedrooms:</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6 c7 subtitle" id="h.m63utsv3tiw1"><span class="c2">Scarlett was trying to explain for the umpteenth time that this affair was not like others. That she really did love Dilyn. William was begging Eden to forgive him, explaining that this was an affair in contrast. It merely played using the &nbsp;Diff&eacute;rance of the two relationships, one loveful, the other loveless. Eden, while acknowledging that there can only be meaning in difference (she bought into Umberto Eco&#39;s theory of semiotics) was having trouble accepting this explanation in practice. All of this boiled down to one central question that was finally voiced by Dilyn.</span></p><p class="c6 c7 subtitle" id="h.m63utsv3tiw1-4"><span class="c2">&quot;If you both truly love your respective spice, then why did you need to see each other?&quot;</span></p><p class="c6 c7 subtitle" id="h.m63utsv3tiw1-5"><span class="c2">&quot;I only had sex with your wife so that I can know how much better it was with my wife who I love,&quot; said William.</span></p><p class="c6 c7 subtitle" id="h.m63utsv3tiw1-6"><span class="c2">&quot;Me too&quot; echoed Scarlet.</span></p><p class="c6 c7 subtitle" id="h.m63utsv3tiw1-7"><span class="c2">This only seemed to raise tensions.</span></p><p class="c6 c7 subtitle" id="h.m63utsv3tiw1-8"><span class="c2">Finally, Dilyn suggested they use modern monitoring solutions to create a micro-surveillance effect that would prevent the couples from engaging each other. William and Scarlett, would each have cameras that recorded video and sound and their phones would send their locations at all times. Which would alert the system if the locations intersected. They also had video cameras installed all over both houses to prevent the couples from meeting without their phones. Eden Milly thought this was sufficient. This provided enough security for both couples to feel safe that the affair would not continue.</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">A month goes by and both former adulterers&#39; &nbsp;find that they have more time to spend with the family they love and this brings them closer. They also get distance to reflect on the past five years and appreciate even more how much a committed relationship brings. Scarlet finds that arguing can be done within the confines of a loving relationship &nbsp;and &nbsp;it brings with it a sense of partnership as well as material rewards:</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6 c7 subtitle" id="h.tddi223nol4n"><span class="c2">Scarlett starts to have more time to discuss the implications of some of her mathematical models on the actual market. Dilyn, who is not as well versed in finance, finds some of the assumptions questionable. Their long discussions turn into heated debates that allow Scarlett to see through the mob psychology of the financial machine and bet heavily against the student loan market and churn a huge profit. To paraphrase Kuhn, &nbsp;arguing about theory releases her from the &nbsp;current paradigm. Used to measuring everything by its monetary value, she finds the fruitfulness of the arguments a proof to &nbsp;the strength of her bond with Dilyn. </span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">However, after a while Scarlett Pallas figures that since they have the video cameras anyway, they may as well watch some recordings. What she finds is that all of her passionate love making is in fact pornographic and not any better than the loveless affair she had carried on. She shows the tape to her husband Dilyn who notices that the springs shock waves which propagate through the mattress are actually a clue to understanding superconducting fluids and wins a Nobel and is amazed that he himself did not think to look at the videos. He is forever grateful to Scarlet and loves her even more. Which he demonstrates by taking an even greater interest in her work. Scarlet, however, is depressed, losses money for the HFT and is fired. Which depresses her further. She then hopes to destroy the marriage of William Hugh and Eden Milly by sending them an email to watch their sex tapes. Although, William is at first hesitant worried that he may not see Eden the same way after, Eden is fascinated by the idea of self-voyeurism -- that they would be able to spy on their past selves who never expected to be watched. However, it turns out that they forgot their password to the recordings and are never able to recover it. Thus their marriage is saved.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Though depressed and with chockful of time to mope, Scarlet is never one to let boredom enter her meaningless existence, always believing that meaninglessness brought it&rsquo;s own freedom, rewards and a stage for ambition. Freed from her obligations to the HFT, she decides that Dilyn and her could move closer to Columbia&rsquo;s campus - away from those toxic assets that could leach into her water supply. She decides to start taking courses, after all, 40 was the new 20 and she could switch careers, lovers, and lives many times before she died. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">In the meantime, Eden is getting fed up reading horrible submissions most of which fall under this new genre called High Frequency History, which is just bad journalism and bad history submitted to her publishing house at an astonishing rate. She decides that it is her duty, or at least a nice break from her day job, to teach a night course on evaluating writing. Her focus will be on evaluating books of theory. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c3">E. Milly drafts her course syllabus. However, as she does this she comes to the realization that she has nowhere to submit this syllabus and she does not believe that an online course in analyzing works of theory can do justice to the topic. In fact, in her mind, online courses are the problem, everyone who watches an online lecture believes they are as expert and as qualified as anyone who has devoted years of their own life to a topic. Sacrifice - being at a specific location at a certain time is sacrifice. More than that she does not know, but she hopes teaching the course will let her discover something essential to &lsquo;good&rsquo; works of theory. The Communist Manifesto and A Treatise of Human Nature were both good even if contradictory, her mind wanders back to the pragmatic. &nbsp;Then she remembers Dilyn at Columbia. She liked him from her first meeting, he had good dental hygiene. So she writes, a letter explaining that she would like to teach a course on Theory and Evaluating Theory and would it be possible for him to help her. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Dilyn who is enjoying much prestige and popularity in the department, receives this unusual request and mentions it to Scarlet. Scarlet finds it intriguing and tells Dilyn she would very much like to enroll and the course can be a trial run and she could help Dilyn evaluate it if only he made an effort to promote it&rsquo;s very existence. Which he does. The department grants Eden a room, a place on the college course bulletin and minimum wage.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Eden is surprised to learn that her course on evaluating works of theory, has somehow been accepted and is considered so hard nosed it is being taught in the Theoretical Physics Building and is considered a Theoretical Physics Elective, cross referenced with Logic, Computer Science and Math, no mention of Philosophy, Writing or Literature departments. Eden doesn&rsquo;t know what to expect on her first day. William assures her that this kind of mistake will win her many points as she will become the most credible and empirical theorist on theory, epistemologically. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Eden is surprised by the number of enrollees, and finds that many of them are Computer Science majors. She quickly learns, the rule of the sandwich eater and how to deal with them. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">The sandwich eater is a know-it-all who comes late to every lecture preferably with a half eaten sandwich and makes comments mid-chew on everything. Eden starts to ask only the sandwich eater if this next comment contains a question, and feining incomprehension or blindness and sometimes all of the above in order to save her the trouble of hearing this poor student&rsquo;s ideas. She sometimes wished that Foucault had been right about controlling knowledge and power, for she felt powerless in her fight against the sandwich eater. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Though her original syllabus contained nothing about the halting problem or the ability to theorize about theory. She finds that somehow CompSci majors are surprisingly engaged in her quest to categorize theory. She learns that Computer Science is actually the study of problem solving and information and that this makes it a prime candidate for her to use as a basin of knowledge for her study. She recruits William to study Computer Science and specifically Shannon&#39;s Information Theory, so that she can be properly prepared to lecture. He teaches her about signals, and how in finance one can differentiate between the signal and noise, because the signal can be summarized, and in that way predicted. In other words, finding a signal in some ways meant finding a new theory. In finance, if you found a theory first, you could profit, because you were the oracle of that theory, until the theory stopped working. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Through the course, the following questions were posed: Can a computer write a book of Theory? Can that book ever be considered Good? Does all Good Theory fundamentally reduce the amount of information that exists in the universe? </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Scarlet, who attends the course, is very familiar with the signal processing concepts, and decides that she must do something random everyday to ensure that her life can never be summarized. Dilyn and Scarlet discuss this course and it is considered a major success. Eden is invited to become a full time professor in the study of interdisciplinary theory. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">William finds that Eden who used to have concrete ideas about things, is now more abstract than ever. She seems less and less concerned if a theory is good or bad despite all the credibility she has now earned. This ironic turn of events disappoints him.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">In the epilogue, William, without a loveless affair, now has nowhere to displace his need for tension in his life. He starts becoming increasingly demanding of those around him, eventually no one can meet his expectations so he decides that he will write about his experiences in the perfect story. The story too never meets his expectations but his wife comes across his writings and after heavy editing publishes what she thinks is salvageable. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
