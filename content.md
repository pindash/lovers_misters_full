<span class="c1">In Lovers and Misters, we meet two couples. All of whom are obviously named after literary giants the work can never hope to evoke. In the second paragraph we are introduced to the characters: </span>

<span class="c1 c3"></span>

<span class="c1">William Hugh works as a Research Analyst for a large corporation Kuotidian INC. His wife Eden Milly is a reader for a large publishing corporation Mc. The Mistress, Scarlet Pallas, works as a  Quant Trader at a small HFT firm O'Bliveeon Asset Management. The Mistress's Husband, Dilyn Thermos, is a professor of condensed matter physics at Columbia studying super conducting liquids. </span>

<span class="c1 c3">​</span>

<span class="c1">T</span><span class="c1 c3">he plot moves pretty swiftly. A five year loveless affair breaks off when the </span><span class="c1">mistress's</span><span class="c1 c3"> husband comes home to find them throwing dinnerware at each other. We </span><span class="c1">learn of their </span><span class="c1 c3">five year relationship in a flashbac</span><span class="c1">k</span><span class="c1 c3">:</span>

<span class="c1 c4 c3"></span>

<span class="c1">It was true. The two had met and it had been hate at first sight. They were drawn to each other like a compressed helical spring. Although they were made of the same metal, there ends were ever expanding outward. Each wanted a taste of loveless relation. They craved the anger, resentment, and meaningless sex, that was missing in their peaceful, loving marriages. Let me undeceive you this was not platonic love. There were no minds embracing, occasionally their bodies met. Mostly, loud and silent words were exchanged. Occasionally it led to all out cutlery tossing. The scars left by these encounters were a testament to both relationships. They signified the permanence of the affair and the complete love and adoration of the respective partners who always believed the most  extraordinary excuses. </span>

<span class="c1 c3"></span>

<span class="c1 c3">The </span><span class="c1 c3">story</span><span class="c1 c3"> </span><span class="c1 c3">then employs dramatic irony as </span><span class="c1 c3">the condensed matter physicist </span><span class="c1 c3">doesn't even understand that an affair is taking place when he </span><span class="c1 c3">walks in</span><span class="c1 c3">, instead </span><span class="c1 c3">he believes </span><span class="c1 c3">that </span><span class="c1 c3">his wife</span><span class="c1 c3"> is </span><span class="c1 c3">defending herself against an assailant: (Who seems to be wearing very fancy attire for such an occasion.)</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Dilyn was coming back early from his lab because his PHD students had commandeered his lab to serve levitating spirits to undergraduates pregaming Orgo night - a Columbia tradition that encourages students to behave irresponsibly in an effort to lower the average on the already difficult Organic Chemistry Final. Professor Thermos maintains his morally neutral position by leaving the students on their own, accepting that he will be cleaning the lab instead of doing research tomorrow. As he walks into his house he hears an intruder, who is being handled by his wife. "Do you need help, honey?" knowing very well that she does not, and that the intruder should have tried another house without one of the toughest quant traders. Some of the probabilistic irony is lost on the intruder. </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1 c3">The adulterers' think they have been discovered and suggest that they should bring this affair to light in front of all affected parties:</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">"I'm fine, it's not what you think" Scarlett screams over the clatter of dishes.</span>

<span class="c1">"Actually it is, your wife and I  have been in a loveless affair for the last five years" explains William. "But I think it's best we have everyone present to discuss this. Perhaps this Saturday?"</span>

<span class="c1">"Alright,  but it  should be a picnic on the beach with sandwiches, I don't want to be stifled by the formality of French Cuisine," she replied.</span>

<span class="c1">"Oh I"ll bring the umbrella" Dilyn muttered.</span>

<span class="c1 c4 c3"></span>

<span class="c1 c4 c3">​</span><span class="c1 c3">At the beach they decide that they must end this affair for good. As a preventative measure they suggest placing video monitors in their bedrooms:</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Scarlett was trying to explain for the umpteenth time that this affair was not like others. That she really did love Dilyn. While William was begging Eden to forgive him, since according to him this was an affair in contrast. It merely played using the  Différance of the two relationships, one loveful, the other loveless. Eden, while acknowledging that there can only be meaning in difference, herself buying in more to Umberto Eco's theory of semiotics was having trouble accepting this explanation in practice. All of this boiled down to one central question that was finally voiced by Dilyn.</span>

<span class="c1">"If you both truly love your respective spice, then why did you need to see each other?"</span>

<span class="c1">"I only had sex with your wife so that I can know how much better it was with my wife who I love," said William.</span>

<span class="c1">"Me too" echoed Scarlet.</span>

<span class="c1">This only seemed to raise tensions.</span>

<span class="c1">Finally, Dilyn suggested they use modern monitoring solutions to create a micro-surveillance effect that would prevent the couples from engaging each other. William and Scarlett, would each have cameras that recorded video and sound and their phones would send their locations at all times. Which would alert the system if the locations intersected. They also had video cameras installed all over both houses to prevent the couples from meeting without their phones. This provided enough security for both couples to feel safe that the affair would not continue.</span>

<span class="c1 c3 c4"></span>

<span class="c1 c3">A month goes by and both former adulterers'  find that they have more time to spend with the family they love and this brings them closer. They also get distance to reflect on the past five years and appreciate even more how much a committed relationship brings. Scarlet finds that arguing can be done within the confines of a loving relationship  and  it brings with it a sense of partnership as well as material rewards:</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Scarlett starts to have more time to discuss the implications of some of her mathematical models on the actual market. Dilyn, who is not as well versed in finance, finds some of the assumptions questionable. Their long discussions turn into heated debates that allow Scarlett to see through the mob psychology of the financial machine and bet heavily against the student loan market and churn a huge profit. To paraphrase Kuhn,  arguing about theory releases her from the  current paradigm. Used to measuring everything by its monetary value, she finds the fruitfulness of the arguments a proof to  the strength of her bond with Dilyn. </span>

<span class="c1 c4 c3"></span>

<span class="c1">However, after a while Scarlett Pallas figures that since they have the video cameras anyway, they may as well watch some recordings. What she finds is that all of her passionate love making is in fact pornographic and not any better than the loveless affair she had carried on. She shows the tape to her husband Diyln who notices that the springs shock waves which propagate through the mattress are actually a clue to understanding superconducting fluids and wins a Nobel and is amazed that he himself did not think to look at the videos. He is forever grateful to Scarlet and loves her even more. Which he demonstrates by taking an even greater interest in her work. Scarlet, however, is depressed, losses money for the HFT and is fired. Which depresses her further. She then hopes to destroy the marriage of William Hugh and Eden Milly by sending them an email to watch their sex tapes. Although, William is at first hesitant worried that he may not see Eden the same way after, Eden is fascinated by the idea of self-voyeurism -- that they would be able to spy on their past selves who never expected to be watched. However, it turns out that they forgot their password to the recordings and are never able to recover it. Thus their marriage is saved.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">In the epilogue, William, without a loveless affair, now has nowhere to displace his need for tension in his life. He starts becoming increasingly demanding of those around him, eventually no one can meet his expectations so he decides that he will write about his experiences in the perfect story. The story too never meets his expectations but his wife comes across his writings and after heavy editing publishes what she thinks is salvageable.  </span>
